Coronavirus pandemic is spreading exponentially through the entire world, taking away thousands of lives everyday.
What can I, as a developer, do to make the situation better? **I can help to raise the awareness of those around me by visualising the data**.

## How does the tracker work?

This project fetches the live data from the [API](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) using **Async/Await** syntax.
**Material UI, Chart.js, React Hooks** were extensively used throughout the project to build the UI, Line and Bar Graphs, and to manipulate the state of the functional components.
